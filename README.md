## bookshelf ðŸ“š

Bookshelf is a web application idea for adding and managing your readings, it's a much simpler idea compared to the [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) app.

I'm working on this project for college and also to practice the Ruby on Rails programming language.

`docker run -p 3000:3000 bookshelf` run application

`docker exec -it container_name bash` open bash
